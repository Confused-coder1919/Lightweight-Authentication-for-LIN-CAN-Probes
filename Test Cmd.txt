1) Quick smoke test — shows normal secure communication

What it does:

Registers 3 probes (0x100, 0x101, 0x102) with the ECU

Runs 5 authentication cycles with a fresh nonce each time

Verifies every message with a MAC and sequence check

Prints authenticated cycles and a few received frames (Seq + MAC)

Run it:

python3 quick_test.py

2) Attack simulator — proves replay & spoofing are blocked

What it does:

Replay attack: sends the same (seq, MAC, data) twice → ECU rejects the second one

Spoofing attack: attacker guesses a MAC without the secret → ECU rejects it

Prints the security log entries showing why it was blocked

Run it:

python3 attack_simulator.py

3) Performance analyzer — shows real-time speed

What it does:

Measures authentication latency (average, min, 95th percentile)

Measures throughput (messages per second) over a short burst

Confirms you’re well below automotive timing budgets (e.g., <10ms)

Run it:

python3 performance_analyzer.py

4) Full integration suite — everything, end to end

What it does:

Tests MAC correctness (Lightweight + Simple)

Runs the virtual CAN network and verifies 5/5 cycles

Runs attack tests (replay & spoof)

Benchmarks performance

Prints the final summary (e.g., 27/27 tests passed)

Run it:

python3 test_suite.py
